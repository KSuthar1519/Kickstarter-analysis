## Overview of Project
### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to see how different campaigns performed based on their launch dates and their funding goals. It also gives an opportunity to extract and present data isolated for types of campaigns and how they fared given their launch dates and what were the exact outcomes. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The Pivot table and Line chart for Outcomes Based on Launch Date provide a clear view of the number of campaigns that “failed”, were “successful” or “cancelled” based on which months of the year they were launched potentially helping draw a correlation if it exists between the Launch date and how they performed. 

The submitted sheet specifically has the information filtered for Parent category “theater”, however with this structure one can easily make separate visual presentations of the same information for other categories.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The worksheet titled “Outcomes Based on Goals” represents the count and percentages of the campaigns that were “successful”, “failed” or were “cancelled” based on the goals in terms of dollar amount range met. These results are filtered specifically for campaigns that fall in the subcategory of “plays” 

Again, other subcategories can be filtered out similarly for the same results.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The first significant challenge personally was to evaluate the raw data, specifically the representation of dates in terms of epoch times and conversion of the same into a format that is easier to read/comprehend. The other challenge was to build codes/formulae with the accuracy to be able to extract out data and present it in different forms of Pivot tables and charts for specific cateogories and subcategories. 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The campaigns that fall in the category of “theaters” had the most “successful” outcome when launched in the month of May followed by June. 
2. It also can be noted that the most number of “theaters” campaigns were launched in the months of May and then June as well. Also, in the month of December the number of campaings that were “successful” and that “failed” were practically same. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
For the campaigns falling in the subcategory of “plays”, the ones that smaller dollar amounts of “goals” (</= $1000) were more “successful” meeting the goal vs the ones that had the highest dollar amounts for their “goals”.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data is presented with the outcomes of success and failure for the campaigns based on whether it was able to reach the goal in dollar amounts set vs what amount was actually pledged. This can probably make programs look like they “failed” in not meeting their goal even though they were actually able to pledge a higher dollar amount. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The other tables that could be made would be to have different “parent categories” and “subcategories” and their outcomes based on the “Pledged”. Also the same data as “Outcomes based on goals” further filtered by the Nationality.
